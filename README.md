# Universal Metric Collector

# Rationale
Operating systems are shipped with different set of tools to get certain system metrics. Moreover the same operating system in different versions may be shipped with toolset giving slightly different output. In such environment it's not possible to relay on standard tools, without ensuring that all of them are returning data in expected format. Such insurance is required when other tools are relaying on data produced by tools - e.g. monitoring tools. Another problem is a human readable format of output generated by standard tools, which typically is not optimal for machine reading. 

# Solution
The solution is to add intermediate format of data exchange between tools and other parts of the system. One of commonly used candidate is a comma value separated plain text format, where the data is separated by comma. The CVS format is well recognized in the industry - format description may be found in RFC 4180. CVS format makes it possible to transport any type of column formatted information, what is typically good enough to share operational metrics of the monitored system.

# Potential issues
Sharing data using CSV files generates several problems. Meaning of data in the CVS files may not clear. Files may be too big to transport and process. Rows of data may be not correlated with time and source. 

# Design decisions
To overcome potential problem with recognition of column meaning, first row of CVS file always contains header with standard names and meaningful description of the data stored in the column. Note that order of columns may vary. Some columns may be missing. It's not clear on this point if extra columns may be added.

To overcome problem of too big files, files may be generated to contain subset of rows e.g. split by time. Each file should however contain first row with header.

to overcome problem of correlation with times and source, each row contains timestamp, system name, and utility name.

# Example
For regular vmstat command executed on Linux 3.11, giving below output

```bash
vmstat 2 3
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----
r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa
1  0      0 523356  32092 125180    0    0    11     2   42  104  1  0 98  1
0  0      0 523224  32092 125180    0    0     0     0   31   74  1  0 99  0
0  0      0 523128  32092 125180    0    0     0     0   28   70  0  1 99  0
```

data collection script generates following CSV file.


```bash
invoke vmstat 2 3
date,time,system,source,ProcessRunQueue,ProcessBlocked,MemSwpd,MemFree,MemBuff,MemCache,SwapReadBlocks,SwapWriteBlocks,IOReadBlocks,IOWriteBlocks,Interrupts,ContextSwitches,CPUuser,CPUsystem,CPUidle,CPUwaitIO
2017-11-07,14:01:12,host1,vmstat,0,0,0,518912,32076,125176,0,0,0,0,36,80,2,1,98,0
2017-11-07,14:01:14,host1,vmstat,0,0,0,518928,32076,125176,0,0,0,0,33,75,1,1,99,0
```

Note that first row from vmstat is omitted as it's presenting data aggregated from start of the system. 


# Implementation
Universal Operating System Metric Collector relays on regular OS utilities, which harvested by a data formatter generate data in desired format. To make metric collection compatible with any version of Unix-like operating system, set of universal scripts is shipped with OS - specific scripts and definition files. OS specific information is stored in directory representing system type, major and minor version. Tool executor verifies if given utility is present in well known directory name. If not error is returned. In the case of missing definition for OS being used, it's possible verify if definitions available for other OS releases are compatible with used system. To verify compatibility UOSMC gets headers from executed utility, and compares it with header valid for other OS version. If header is the same, it's assumed that data produced by the utility is compatible as well.

Ideally UOSMC should use scripts from highest major version of the operating system. If it's not compatible should look for proper scripts in minor version directory.

```bash
$uosmcRoot................... root directory of UOSMC
$uosmcRoot/bin............... shared scripts compatible with all os, based on gnu utilities
$uosmcRoot/tools............. directory with top level OS type
$uosmcRoot/tools/Linux....... directory with Linux related files
$uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0... directory with Linux 3 related files valid for all 3.x Linux relases
$uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/11.. directory with Linux 3.11 version specific files
```

## vmstat
Let's take a look at implementation of vmstat on Linux 3.11, which is identical to iostat.

Raw header file is used as a fingerprint of OS specific utility. First line of the file contains information which part of the output should be used as a header to compare. For vmstat it's two first lines, thus directive says: cfg:lines:1,2. Internally it's passed to sed command, which takes first two lines from vmstat output. 

```bash
cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/vmstat.rawheader 
cfg:line:1,2
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa
```

Header file is added always on top of CSV data file. Note that apart from vmstat specific information there is always added set of four columns: date, time, hostname, and utility name.

```bash
cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/vmstat.header 
date,time,system,source,ProcessRunQueue,ProcessBlocked,MemSwpd,MemFree,MemBuff,MemCache,SwapReadBlocks,SwapWriteBlocks,IOReadBlocks,IOWriteBlocks,Interrupts,ContextSwitches,CPUuser,CPUsystem,CPUidle,CPUwaitIO
```

Finally the vmstat invocation wrapper is an executable script formatting vmstat output to reach desired CSV format matching header in vmstat.header file.

```bash
cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/vmstat
#!/bin/bash

delay=$1
count=$2
vmstat -n $delay $count
| sed $sedBUFFER 's/  */,/g;s/^,//;s/,$//' \
| sed -n $sedBUFFER '1,2!p'  \
| sed -n $sedBUFFER '1!p'
#Comments
#1. vmstat -n -> prevents vmstat from printing headers after some number of lines
#2. $sedBuffer - controls adding "-u" option which control buffering. On this stage script should work in unbuffered mode
#3. s/... -> replace spaces to comma; removes first and last comma  
#4. sed -n 1,2 -> remove first two lines - header lines
#5. sed -n 1!p -> remove first line which contains average numbers measured from start of the system
```

The output of vmstat is the following:

```bash
date,time,system,source,ProcessRunQueue,ProcessBlocked,MemSwpd,MemFree,MemBuff,MemCache,SwapReadBlocks,SwapWriteBlocks,IOReadBlocks,IOWriteBlocks,Interrupts,ContextSwitches,CPUuser,CPUsystem,CPUidle,CPUwaitIO
2017-11-07,15:09:30,ubuntu,vmstat,0,0,0,518408,32812,125248,0,0,0,0,40,100,3,1,96,0

2017-11-07,15:09:32,ubuntu,vmstat,0,0,0,518440,32812,125248,0,0,0,0,32,79,0,1,99,0

```

## ifconfig
Definition of ifconfig utility is more complex, as there is no simple header line and output generated by ifconfig is multiline per single interface.

```bash
ifconfig 
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:1c:42:ec:f5:ce  
          inet addr:10.37.129.5  Bcast:10.37.129.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fdb2:2c26:f4e4:1:9dfb:894e:26ce:3d0/64 Scope:Global
          inet6 addr: fdb2:2c26:f4e4:1:21c:42ff:feec:f5ce/64 Scope:Global
          inet6 addr: fe80::21c:42ff:feec:f5ce/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:152755 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:143897 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
          RX bytes:10583719 (10.5 MB)  TX bytes:16034794 (16.0 MB)
```

Raw header, used to verify compatibility of ifconfig utility, is based on a script as it's not possible to just take some lines as it was doable with vmstat and iostat. Property file specifying raw header instructs that the script should be used, which will extract header information from executed ifconfig utility to produce output compared with expected header stored in second line.

```bash
cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/ifconfig.rawheader 
cfg:script:ifconfig.validateheader.sh
RXpackets:errors:dropped:overruns:frame:TXpackets:errors:dropped:overruns:carrier:collisions:txqueuelen:RXbytes:TXbytes:
```

Raw header extraction script extracts rows used by CVS data extraction logic, but instead of using numbers from the lines, uses ASCII characters. It's a perfect raw header fingerprint proving compatibility of ifconfig utility. 

```bash
cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/ifconfig.validateheader.sh 
#!/usr/bin/bash

ifname=$(ifconfig | cut -f1 -d' '| head -1)
ifconfig $ifname | grep -i X | sed 's/[0-9]//g' | sed 's/(. \w*B)//g' | tr -d ' ' | tr -d '\n'

Header file for ifconfig output looks following:

cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/ifconfig.header 
date,time,system,source,device,RXpackets,RXerrors,RXdropped,RXoverruns,RXframe,TXpackets,TXerrors,TXdropped,TXoverruns,TXcarrier,collisions,txqueuelen,RXbytes,TXbytes

Finally the ifconfig invocation wrapper is an executable script formatting vmstat output to reach desired CSV format matching header in vmstat.header file.

cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/ifconfig
#!/bin/bash

#get interface name
netlist=$1

#if no parameter is specified get data from all interfeces
if [ -z $netlist ]; then
  netlist=ALL
fi

#extract interface names
if [ "$netlist" = "ALL" ]; then 
  netlist=$(ifconfig | grep "^[a-zA-Z]" | cut -d ' ' -f1)
fi

#collect data for each interface
for net in $netlist; do 
   ifconfig $net \
   | grep -i X \
   | perl $toolsBin/joinlines.pl -stop "RX bytes" \
   | sed $sedBUFFER 's/[a-zA-Z:]//g' \
   | sed $sedBUFFER 's/  */,/g' \
   | cut -d',' -f2-6,8-13,14-15,18,21  \
   | perl -ne "$perlBUFFER; print \"$net,\$_\";"
#1. grep -i X -> get rows with "x". It's set of rows in are of our interest
#2. joinlines.pl -> join multiline information into one line. Note that on a third line there is "RX bytes" byte sequence
#3. $sedBUFFER -> control buffering of data. Not used.
#4. s/[a-zA-Z:]//g -> remove all non letters and semi colons
#5. s/  */,/g -> replace spaces with comma
#6. -f2-6,8-13,14-15,18,21 -> selects columns with information
#7. print interface information at beginning of each line.
done
```

The output of ifconfig is the following:

```bash
invoke ifconfig 1 5 eth0
date,time,system,source,device,RXpackets,RXerrors,RXdropped,RXoverruns,RXframe,TXpackets,TXerrors,TXdropped,TXoverruns,TXcarrier,collisions,txqueuelen,RXbytes,TXbytes
2017-11-07,16:00:22,ubuntu,ifconfig,eth0,154267,0,0,0,0,144759,0,0,0,0,,0,1000,10711689,16167120
2017-11-07,16:00:22,ubuntu,ifconfig,eth0,154270,0,0,0,0,144762,0,0,0,0,,0,1000,10711887,16167614
2017-11-07,16:00:24,ubuntu,ifconfig,eth0,154273,0,0,0,0,144766,0,0,0,0,,0,1000,10712085,16168182
2017-11-07,16:00:24,ubuntu,ifconfig,eth0,154276,0,0,0,0,144768,0,0,0,0,,0,1000,10712283,16168410

```

You probably noted that by default ifconfig does not work in a loop, just presenting data per invocation. That's correct, and the invocation loop is a special option of each utility, which is recognized and controlled by UOSMC. Special needs are stored in $cmd.properties file. In case of ifconfig the file informs invocation logic that looped invocation must be handled by UOSMC.

```bash
cat $uosmcRoot/tools/Linux/3/0/ifconfig.properties 
loop:external
```

## invoke
Heart of the UOSMC is an invoke function which takes parameters of utility name, optional debug flag, interval and number of executions. Invoke decodes operating system version, finds proper script directory, controls buffering, checks of utility is installed on the system, controls continuous run, and adds header, timestamp, and hostname.

```bash
function invoke {

  unset DEBUG
  if [ "$1" = "DEBUG" ]; then
        export uosmcDEBUG=DEBUG
        shift
  fi

  export cmd=$1
  shift

  #setBuffered or not buffered operation
  cfgBuffered

  #decode current system version 
  decodeVersion

  #locate tool definition directory
  locateToolExecDir $cmd
  if [ $? -eq 3 ]; then
    return 3
  fi

  #check if tool is installed on this platform
  assertInvoke $cmd
  if [ $? -eq 2 ]; then
    return 2
  fi

  #check if looping is requited
  if [ -f $toolExecDir/$cmd.properties ]; then
    loop=$(cat $toolExecDir/$cmd.properties | grep loop | cut -d':' -f2)
  fi

  if [ "$loop" = "external" ]; then
     loop=true
     interval=$1
     count=$2
     shift 2
  fi

  #hostname
  hostname=$(hostname)

  #print headers
  cat $toolExecDir/$cmd.header

  #run the tool
  if [ "$loop" = "true" ]; then
    $toolsBin/timedExec.sh $interval $count $uosmcDEBUG $toolExecDir/$cmd $1 $2 $3 $4 \
    | perl -ne "$perlBUFFER; print \"$hostname,$cmd,\$_\";" \
    | $toolsBin/addTimestamp.pl $addTimestampBUFFER
  else
    $toolExecDir/$cmd $1 $2 $3 $4 \
    | perl -ne "$perlBUFFER; print \"$hostname,$cmd,\$_\";" \
    | $toolsBin/addTimestamp.pl $addTimestampBUFFER
  fi
}
```

## locateCompatibleVersions
For operating systems with not compatible scripts it's possible to execute header tests for all known minor versions for the same major version. Below scripts shows list of compatible versions using three utilities: vmstat, iostat, and ifconfig.

Once executed automatically goes trough all versions, and generates summary report.

```bash
locateCompatibleVersions

```

Details of the function are presented below.

```bash
function locateCompatibleVersions {

 if [ -z $tools ]; then
  tools="iostat vmstat ifconfig"

 done

 echo
 echo Summary of compatible versions. 
 cat $uosmcRoot/tools/$system_type/$version_major/$version_minor/*.Success | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r | egrep "^\s+$toolCnt"
}
```

# TODO Tools
1. ping
2. Add node column to identify process e.g. WebLogic instance on a host

# TODO General
1. Automatically execute test for given OS with '0' level utilities. Once executed stores information in directory that test was passed or failed. Invoke should use this information.
2. Invoke performs header test upon first run to write result to files. During next runs it's verified if test was passed or not.

# Open issues
1. Are extra columns allowed in CSV file?
2. Recognize data formatting returned by OS tools. Is decimal delimiter a dot or comma?
3. Add data description to fields: scale min, max, logarithmic, delta, data label as e.g. kB, MB/s
4. Add data correlation information
5. Add data hierarchy information to fields e.g. ProcessRunQueue -> cpu.ProcessRunQueue
